This is a small project done quickly (2 days) to demonstrate a few development features.
If you cannot access the database, i will leave the table creation scripts further down, or if you know how to configure the IP to connect to the database, the server has a permission for the following IP: 201.43.124.212.
The idea is to update the project when i have more time



Scripts:


CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Accounts]
(
    [AccountId] INT IDENTITY(1,1),
    [Name] NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    [AccountNumber] INT NOT NULL,
    [CurrentBalance] FLOAT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FinancialTransaction](
    [TransactionId] INT IDENTITY(1,1),
    [DestinationAccount] int not null,
    [Description] NVARCHAR(200) null,
    [Value] FLOAT NOT NULL,
    [Nature] int NOT NULL
);
